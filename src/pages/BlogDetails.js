      <p>Sheltering in place means staying indoors during an emergency situation, rather than evacuating. This approach is often used during incidents like chemical spills, active shooter situations, or severe weather events.</p>

Ensure that the room is stocked with necessary supplies, such as food, water, medications, and a communication device. Seal windows and doors if necessary to prevent contaminants from entering.</p>
      <p>Stay informed about the situation through reliable sources and follow any instructions from authorities. Remain in the safe room until the threat has passed or it is deemed safe to leave. Once the situation is under control, assess any potential damage and take appropriate actions based on guidance from emergency services.</p>
